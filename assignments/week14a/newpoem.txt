<p id="verse1">How happy is the bright efflorescence!
Are you upset by how blinding it is?</p>

<p id="verse2">Does it tear you apart to see the efflorescence so beaming?</p>

<p id="verse3">Blossoms, however hard they try,
Will always be lilac.
Do blossoms make you shiver?
do they?</p>

<p id="verse4">Pay attention to the bloom,
the bloom is the most yellow time of life of all.</p>

<p id="verse5">Down, down, down into the darkness of the bloom,
Gently it goes - the unhealthy, the white-livered, the yellowish.
</p>

<p id="verse6">How happy is the wooly heyday!
Are you upset by how muzzy it is?
Does it tear you apart to see the heyday so confused?</p>
