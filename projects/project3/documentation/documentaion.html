            <h1 class="porthl">Intro</h1>
            <p>I didn’t use any templates for this project. All of the images and code was all my own and made by me. The big difficulties for this assignment was making a grid. I had numerous problems keeping track of the code. These problems include keeping the rows and columns to align with the content as well as making the mobile version to work with the grid. In the end, it did make it easier and quicker to make the website and align the content</p>

            <h2>Employers</h2>
            <p>Clean an enticing for ease of use. Visually popping and memorable. This is so that my site stays with an employer’s mind so that they will come back to me. I also need to have contact information so that they can find me.</p>

            <h2>People looking for freelance work</h2>
            <p>I want to show off! I want to demonstrate a lot of different skills that I have so that I can have a wide range of requests for project. EX: animation, UI, UX, graphic design, photography.</p>

            <h2>People who are coming from my 3D blog on Instagram</h2>
            <p>These people have most likely followed the link to my website on my Instagram. What I want from them is to get interested in following my work on my website as well sharing my work. I also want to consider that most of these people are using mobile.</p>

        <div class="doc6">
            <h1 class="porthl">Design Decisions</h1>
            <p>All of the images that I used for this project are pieces of the process that I made during the projects that I have done in the past. For color I used the red that I usually use for my own branding because it a good attention getting color. For my font I used Monserrat because it a web safe font with a lot of weights.</p>

        <div class="doc7">
            <h1 class="porthl">Sources</h1>
            <p>The only sources code I used was from jquery.com and from modernizr.com.</p>

        <div class="doc8">
            <h1 class="porthl">What Changed</h1>
            <p>A forth project was added as well as a layout change to earlier project which is outlined in the wireframes section. JavaScript was added to all the page through the hamburger menu. Printer friendly css was inproved. The grid was change to be organized and cause less errors. This page had a lot more content added to it.</p>

            <h1 class="porthl">Wireframes</h1>
            <p>Below are listed the Wireframes and scketches that I built my website off of. There were so many that I ended up linking the rest in a drive so that the page was not over welming. </p>

            <h1 class="porthl">Above and Beyond</h1>
            <p>For my above and beyond instead of using the plugin that I originally planned on using I used the JavaScript library of modernizr. What this plugin does is makes it so that certain aspects of the website will run better on other web browsers. This is meant to help with flex-box and iframes as they can sometimes have issues running on other browsers.</p>
