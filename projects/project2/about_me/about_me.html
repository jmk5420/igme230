    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>My name is John Keefe and I am an aspiring UX/UI and motion designer in Rochester NY. I am currently in my 3rd year at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New Media Design.</p>
    <p>I got my start with free design software when I was going to high school in New Hampshire. But I worked my way to paying for actually design equipment and now have a stronger focus on animation and UX/UI. I’m a big fan of older design trends such as vaporwave and the MTV era of design.</p>
