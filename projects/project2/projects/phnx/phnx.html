    <h2 class="porthl">Who is the PHNX?</h2>
    <p class="portbod">Khalen Roye, aka PHNX is a music producer and rapper from the Boston area.</p>
    <h2 class="porthl">The Goal</h2>
    <p class="portbod">The goal of this project was to create a short bumper that showed the visual style that the client wanted to convey not only in his music but in his branding</p>
    <h2 class="porthl">The Questions</h2>
    <p class="portbod">What software should I use to create this bumper? What feeling do I get from listening to the client’s music? How do I show the clients style while recreating it for an animation?</p>
    <h2 class="porthl">The Solution</h2>
    <p class="portbod">I decide to do the bumper in both After Effects and Cinema 4D to keep the piece visually interesting and to be able to tie the message of the bumper together. The message being to check out the clients Sound Cloud account. For the feeling of the bumper, I listened to the client’s music for a few hours to get a feeling for it and then came up with the idea of the empty canyon with the lighting and colors being inspired by the vaporwave style</p>
    <h2 class="porthl">Style Experimentation</h2>
    <p class="portbod">Here is where I played with different lighting and texture to find what I wanted to do with the look of this project</p>
